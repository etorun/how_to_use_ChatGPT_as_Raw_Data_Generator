# 🎯 Goals

This project aims to showcase the help of Chat GPT creating a mock data. 
For any kind of data projects, rather than working with a random data, you can create a business-related data and work on real business cases/tasks/questions/problems. 

This project creates a mock data in **Chat GPT**, builds a local data warehouse using **PostgreSQL**, models the data in **DBeaver**, and creates **Tableau** Public dashboards.
